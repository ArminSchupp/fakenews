## True or untrue that's the question

In addition, it should be clear that this is not a fundamental protection against any kind of false report. On the one hand, such a block list can never be 100% complete and on the other hand, many false reports are spread without a source via Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites. Even serious news sites don't always report the truth (but at least correct it afterwards if something turns out to be untrue). The most important thing is still to question all reports and if necessary to get an objective picture of the news situation with the help of alternative sources.

If the fake news filter is activated, you can no longer access the pages listed in the block list. This makes it much clearer if you want to check explosive news quickly for their truth content before you spread them e.g. in social networks and are therefore even misused for propaganda purposes.

Don't be fooled - use the fake news filter today.

## The decision about what is true or untrue must also be reviewed by you

# üôà fakenews
An in-progress collection of fake news outlets. Currently blocking 669 untrustworthy sites.

## Purpose
This is a small attempt to limit my exposure to sites that fall under the umbrella of ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù It blocks sites that willfully and regularly spread clickbait, hoaxes, propaganda and disinformation.

## Usage
This file is formatted as a standard [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), so you can simply append it to your current hosts file. I recommend using it with [@StevenBlack‚Äôs hosts tool](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), which lets you build a robust hosts file from a variety of frequently updated sources.

Where to find your hosts file:
- Mac OS, Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## Personal Bias Disclosure
Defining what is or is not ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in today‚Äôs political environment is challenging. Within a few weeks of the 2016 U.S. election, the term quickly became adopted by many to simply mean ‚Äúnews I don‚Äôt agree with.‚Äù Looking at the list, you may notice the vast majority of political sites blocked are far-right conservative in focus. While I would consider myself centrist to left-leaning, I have made a concerted effort to limit this list to sites that meet the purpose listed above. There are certainly additions and omissions to this list which would be judged differently by another curator. I encourage you to edit this list to meet your needs as you see fit.

## Improvements
I initially built this file mostly by grabbing bits and pieces from various sources, and then adding sites on an ad-hoc basis as I learned of them, so this list is by no means complete yet. Please submit pull requests with additions and corrections.

In the future, this list will be broken out by category (e.g. ‚ÄúHoaxes‚Äù, ‚ÄúSatire‚Äù, ‚ÄúPropaganda‚Äù etc) to enable easier customization for the end user.
