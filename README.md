# fakenews
An in-progress collection of fake news sites.

## Purpose
This is a small attempt to limit my access to sites that generally fall under the umbrella of “fake news.” It blocks sites that willfully spread clickbait, hoaxes, propaganda and disinformation. The criteria is admittedly fairly loose.

## Usage
This file is formatted as a standard [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), so you can simply append it to your current hosts file. I recommend using it with @StevenBlack’s [hosts file tool](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), which lets you easily build a robust hosts file from a variety of sources.

Where to find your hosts file:
- Mac OS, Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## Improvements
I built this list mostly by grabbing bits and pieces from various sources compiled after the Nov 2016 U.S. elections, so this list is by no means complete yet. Please submit pull requests with additions and corrections.
