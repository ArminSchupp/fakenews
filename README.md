# üôà fakenews
An in-progress collection of fake news outlets. Currently blocking 519 untrustworthy sites.

## Purpose
This is a small attempt to limit my exposure to sites that fall under the umbrella of ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù It blocks sites that willfully spread clickbait, hoaxes, propaganda and disinformation.

## Usage
This file is formatted as a standard [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), so you can simply append it to your current hosts file. I recommend using it with [@StevenBlack‚Äôs hosts tool](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), which lets you build a robust hosts file from a variety of frequently updated sources.

Where to find your hosts file:
- Mac OS, Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## Improvements
I built this file mostly by grabbing bits and pieces from various sources compiled after the Nov 2016 U.S. elections, so this list is by no means complete yet. Please submit pull requests with additions and corrections.
